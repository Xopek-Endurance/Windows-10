Mint Applets icons is not in icon folder of any themes (or I don't know about it?), because of this to change this icons i replaced icons in apllet system folder, in my case /usr/share/cinnamon/applets/ and you need to do this carefully and make a backup before doing this Icons that i replaced, in file
